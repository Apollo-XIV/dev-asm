# The Client

Dev-ASM: Community oriented around low level programming.

Brief: Dev-ASM initially started as a small group of learners wanting to help 
eachother learn x86Assembly. As their community has grown, they eventually
moved from a mailing list to a discord server, and now are looking to migrate
once again to a standalone forum.

// For my project, I felt like it'd be a nice idea to make a forum, especially
given how much time I've sank into them over the years, so this project is my
attempt at coming full-circle.
--------

# At a Glance
app code: A WASM Frontend UI written in Rust and Integrated backend using the 
Leptos Framework.

hosting: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform on AWS

db: Postgres
 
// Okay, so, these are the main technologies I made use of throughout my
project. I'm going to apologise in advance, as there are a lot of acronyms and
not enough time. 
--------

# App Code


// This was truly the meat of the project and at multiple points floored me 
completely. Firstly, I decided to write my project in Rust. For the uninformed 
and uninitiated, rust is a systems langauge that mixes low level control with
high level ergonomics, or so they tell me. Rust is a language I've been
learning on my own already, so this seemed a great opportunity to try and build
a larger project.
